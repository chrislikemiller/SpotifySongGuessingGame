If you ever played Hitster, but you only have spotify, you can create your own game with a custom playlist. :)

Requirements: **.NET 5**

Features:
- Downloading playlist information via Spotify dev API
- Using playlist as seed to grab top N songs of the artists in the playlist
- Musicbrainz API support to refresh release dates (very experimental, not 100% reliable, and neither is Spotify)
- Easier release date manual updating by auto-opening google searches. (note: I tried automating this too, but the html responses are too varied to parse reliably)
- Create playcard images to print (front and back)
- Create collages of previously generated images. Optimized for A4 printing and **VERTICAL** flipping
- Create collage of little "coins" to play with
